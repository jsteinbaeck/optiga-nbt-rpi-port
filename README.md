This is a detailed guide on porting OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT's Host Library for C to Raspberry Pi OS interacting via the I2C interface.

## Overview

The guide outlines the process of setting up the development environment, confirguring the Raspberry Pi and adapting the host code for compatibility.

Refer to the [OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Host Library for C: User guide](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-nbt-lib-c/blob/main/docs/userguide.md) repository to understand the features and functionality of the host library, including an architecture overview and descriptions of the host library's components.

## Setup and requirements
This section contains information on how to setup and interface the OPTIGAâ„¢ Authenticate NBT with Raspberry Pi.

### Hardware requirements
1. Raspberry Pi 4/5
2. OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield

**Table 1. Mapping of the OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield's pins to Raspberry Pi**

| OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield | Raspberry Pi | Function |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| SDA                           | GPIO 2        | I2C data                   |
| SCL                           | GPIO 3        | I2C clock                  |
| IRQ                           | NC        | Interrupt                  |
| 3V3                           | 3V3                     | Power and pad supply (3V3) |
| GND                           | GND                     | Common ground reference    |

The Raspberry Pi's pins need to be connected to the OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield as shown in the table.

### Modify confirguration file
To change the I2C speed and baudrate on a Raspberry Pi, you need to modify the `config.txt` file. The I2C interface on the Raspberry Pi can be configured to operate at different speeds by setting appropriate parameters in this file.
1. Open the `config.txt` file located in the `/boot` directory.
```text
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
2. To set the I2C speed, you need to add or modify the dtparam entry for the I2C bus. The parameter `i2c_arm_baudrate` is used to set the baud rate for the ARM I2C interface.
```text
# Enable I2C interface
dtparam=i2c_arm=on

dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
```
3. After saving the confirguration file, reboot the system for changes to take effect.

### Development tools
`CMake`, `GCC` and `Make` tools are commonly required for compiling and building software projects from source.

```text
#Update the package list first
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install cmake gcc make
```
